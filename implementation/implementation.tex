\chapter{Implementation*}

In this section, the architecture of the entire concept bottleneck pipeline, as well as more detail unrelated to logical modelling, is presented.
Since, the work in this thesis is a continuation of the previous unpublished work, laid out in \autoref{inherited-work}, this section may include some parts which do not constitute my work. 
The * sign is used to signify the work that is not the work of the author of the thesis.

\subsection{Dependencies}

\textbf{Sentence Transformers}: A library which provides access to pre-trained transformers. 
Since it is only used in the grouping stage, the ease of use of the library was the main reason for the selection of the library.


Finally, \textbf{numpy}, \textbf{scikit-learn}, \textbf{matplotlib}, \textbf{panadas} which all are famous Python libraries used with AI projects. \\
